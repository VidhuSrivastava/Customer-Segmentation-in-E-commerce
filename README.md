# Customer-Segmentation-in-E-commerce# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation in E-commerce

This project uses machine learning to segment e-commerce customers based on their behavior. By grouping customers into clusters, businesses can understand their audience better and create more effective marketing strategies.

## 📌 Objective

- Segment customers using unsupervised learning
- Analyze behavior using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model
- Identify patterns in customer data to drive personalized marketing

## 🧾 RFM Analysis

RFM stands for:

- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frequency**: How often they purchase
- **Monetary**: How much they spend

RFM analysis helps create customer features that reflect loyalty and engagement.

## 📊 Techniques Used

- **Data Preprocessing**
- **RFM Feature Engineering**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Elbow Method and Silhouette Score** for choosing optimal clusters
- **Cluster Visualization**

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data handling
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – machine learning (KMeans, metrics, preprocessing)
